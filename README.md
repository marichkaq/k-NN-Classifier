# k-NN Classifier

Welcome to the k-NN Mini-Project repository! This project involves implementing a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) classifier. The program takes three arguments: the value of k, the name of the file containing the training set, and the name of the file containing the test set. The goal is to classify data points and evaluate the model's performance using accuracy.

Features:

* Dataset Loading: Load any dataset in CSV format.
* k-NN Classifier: Implementation of the k-NN algorithm.
* Performance Evaluation: Calculate and output accuracy.
* User Input Classification: A simple command-line interface to input vectors for classification.
* Flexible Data Usage: The program can load and classify data from different CSV files.
* Graph Generation: Prepare a graph using Python to show the accuracy versus the value of k.

Project Insights:
Working on this project provided me with a deeper understanding of several key concepts and techniques:

* Implementing and fine-tuning the k-NN algorithm.
* Effectively handling and processing datasets in CSV format.
* Visualizing the performance of machine learning models using graphs.
* Experimenting with different values of k to observe their impact on accuracy.
  
This project was particularly valuable as it enhanced my skills in both Java and Python, and deepened my understanding of machine learning concepts. I am proud of the work accomplished and look forward to applying these insights to more advanced projects.
